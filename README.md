## Things The Program Does


When users launch our application, they'll encounter a maze resembling the one presented here. Their task is to navigate a small ball, similar to the blue one, through the maze, ultimately reaching a designated targetâ€”the green square at the bottom left corner. Using the W, A, and D keys, users guide the ball towards the goal, and upon reaching the green square, they achieve victory.
